# Web Development Portfolio ✨

This is my final project for the Intro to Web Development course. 
It's a multi-page Portfolio site that showcases my journey as a web developer, with a project showcase, an About Me section, and a working contact form. 

## Live Demo 
[View Portolio on GitHub Pages](https://hanari-dev.github.io/Portfolio-Final/)

## Languages 
- HTML5 (semantic structure, multi-page site)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, animations, responsive design)
- JavaScript (DOM events, arrays, loops, form validation)

## Project Structure 
- index.html (Main Homepage, Project Showcase Section, Mini About Me Section)
- about.html (About Me Page)
- contact.html (Contact Form)
- styles.css (Styling for all pages)
- main.js (Timeline in the About Me Page and Form Validation)
- images folder (5 Projecct Images)

## Features Made Using Concepts taught from Lecture Materials 
- Semantic HTML Structures (header, nav, section, footer)
- Navigation Bar (across 3 pages)
- Project Grid with Images and Links
- About Me Section with a Timeline generated using JavaScript arrays and loops
- Contact Form with name, email, and message imputs
- JavaScript basics using arrays, objects, functions, loops and DOM Selection 
- Responsive Design with Media Queries 

## Extra Features I Researched and added that weren't taught in the Lecture Materials 
- [CSS Variables (Custom Properties)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
- [CSS Transitions & cubic-bezier easing (for hover/scale animations)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)
- [Emoji favicon (✨ in the browser tab)](https://css-tricks.com/emoji-as-a-favicon/)
- [Form validation with Regular Expressions (email pattern)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions)
- [Preventing Default Form Behavior (event.preventDefault)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
- [ARIA Live Regions (for accessible error messages)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions)

## Accessibility 
- Alt text added to all images
- Consistent headings and semantic HTML

- Connect the contact form to a backend service 
- Add dark mode support
